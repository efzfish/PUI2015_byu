In assignment 1, I generated 100 samples of different sizes from each of 6 different distributions (Poisson, Normal, chi-squared, Geometric, Exponential and Binomial), all with the same population mean 100. Then I plotted the sample mean against the sample size for each distribution, and the result is as expected since the mean would be more close to 100 when the size become larger.
Then I plotted the distributions of all sample means for each distribution and fitted them with Normal distribution.

The notebook can be run as normal ipython notebooks.
