Clarity:
Generally, the plot is easy to read.
The plot reflects the relationship between CO2 emission and population size (logarithm scale) with proper title and legend. However, there is no indication of units on each axis, and this may cause some confusion.

Esthetic:
The color is chosen appropriately yet the transparency seems weird. Perhaps it would be better to set a bigger alpha. Using size of dots to represent city density is intuitive and presentative. 

Honesty:
Data are represented in logarithm scale and the plot is honestly reproducing the data without any distortions.

Suggestion:
1.Labelling the names a few cities with distinct values of carbon emission or population size. This may help readers more intuitively figure out the special sample.  
2.Adding the units at each axis.
3.Making more consideration on the chosen of dot color.
