10/10


NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
=================


too many classes for redeability: they end up being indistinguishable in the plot

the three dots in the legend (default) should be changed to 1 point since they are redundant and in a plot like this they overlap

the emptiness of the plot makes it difficult to see structure: a compressed y axis would be better

the number of users is redundant with the size of the dot. information should be delivered once clearly, but only once



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
==================================



amp914
======


the overlapping bars are confusing because they change the hue of the underlying color


the labels are small
the ticj labels are missing on the x axis. at least a few should be marked

assigning blue to man and pink to wome triggers preconceptions and stereotypes

it is not clear at first what the numbers refer to.

chosing blue for mand and pink for women triggers stereotypes and preconceptions

==

nice simple plot

too much empty space on the top: distracting (and even on the left)

small tick labels


tg
==


too many vivid colors are distracting

agegroup one word in the tiel

thousands is not ameaningful axis labels; use "Population (units of 1,000 peope")

and then why use units of 1000 when your first tick label is 1e5? then one has to think what 1e5*1000 is. use units of millions, and then your first tick is 100 etc
